config SYSCTL
	bool "sysctl interface"
	default y
	help
	  Enable use of the sysctl interface.

config MM
	bool "Memory Management"
	default y
	help
	  Enable use of the memory block management system. See the
	  platform-specific settings menu for configuration options.
	  Please note that the choices you make can have significant impact on
	  the memory footprint of the tracker, since each minimum block unit
	  requires one bit to track its usage status. For example, with an
	  upper block order of 32 and a lower block order of 12, i.e. a memory
	  size of 4 GiB and a page size of 4 kiB requires bit map space of
	  1 MiB.

	default 10
	help
	  Limit the number of pages released back to the system break.
	  This prevents extra time spent releasing pages when deallocating very
	  large memory buffers. The remaining unused memory will be naturally
	  released over time during subsequent kmalloc()/kfree() calls or
	  in the background by if KMEM_RELEASE_BACKGROUND is enabled
	  Note: if set to 0, RELEASE_UNUSED_LAZY is effectively disabled
	  Beware: if KMEM_RELEASE_BACKGROUND is enabled, leave this number in
	  the low 10s

	depends on PAGE_MAP
	bool "Extra check for alignment in page address"
	default n
	help
	  Make sure the address of the allocated page is really aligned
	  to the page size of the underlying memory manager. This does not
	  prevent misconfiguration, just adds a functional verification step.

config PAGE_MAP_MOVE_NODE_AVAIL_THRESH
	depends on PAGE_MAP
	int "Threshold for empty page node to be considered filled again"
	default 1
	range 1 1024
	help
	  When page map node run out of pages, they are moved to a list of
	  empty nodes until a number of pages are freed, defined by the
	  threshold above. If unsure, use a threshold of 1.

config CHUNK
	bool "Memory Chunk Manager"
