\noindent
LeanOS\cite{ssdpOS}\cite{leanosADD}\cite{leanosSRS} is an operating system specifically
designed to support hardware devices with drivers and data processing on the
\gls{Xentium} \glspl{DSP} of the \gls{SSDP}.\\

In LeanOS, the \gls{SSDP} hardware is accessed in multiple layers of
abstraction (see \fig{fig:logical_model}). Typical \gls{CPU} tasks such as
thread/task management and timer operation are used as part of the operating
system kernel and are also accessible by user applications via a system call
interface.  Other functional hardware components of the \gls{SSDP} such as the
\gls{NoC} \gls{DMA} have their own driver modules. These are in turn used by
the \gls{Xentium} scheduler and other higher level modules in the operating
system.  Configuration of and access to the latter from user space is done via
a system call interface. The system control interface serves as an intermediate
between all layers of the operating system, where system or module states and
hardware modes or usage statistics may be exported by individual components for
external (user) access. \\

\noindent
The compliance of LeanOS with its requirements and its operational environment
are partially verified by testing.


\section{Purpose of the Document}

This document defines test procedures for the for the LeanOS operating system.
In particular, it defines the:
\begin{itemize}
	\item types of tests
	\item environment in which the test are executed
	\item coverage of the test
	\item entity responsible for performing the test
\end{itemize}


\section{Incremental Testing}

LeanOS is not envisaged to be implemented in one final form. Instead, it is
marked with version numbers for each release. This means that testing is
version-dependent and is be applied in increments by executing a sub-set of
tests only as modifications are made.


\section{Test Sequences}

Test defined in this document are executed by automated test sequences in the
form of software programs that control the execution of a test, check the
correctnes of the results and generate a summary report.



\section{Items Under Test}

Components and software modules of the operating system are tested on an
unit-level where applicable. System level tests are tailored to the
various configuration options avaiable. and shall be accompanied by
configuration files so the proper build may generated.\\
\\

\requirement{IUT-0001} {Hardware constraints}{%
The test plan specified by the present requirements shall apply to all parts %
of LeanOS.
}{}



\section{Operational Constraints}

Each test shall specify the minimum hardware platform on which it must be
performed. Unit-level test of platform-independent components may be executed
on any compatible hardware. Platform-dependent tests may require specific
hardware models (e.g. the \gls{SSDP} for testing of the \gls{NoC}) or just any
compatible processor model (e.g. \gls{LEON3} for testing the operation of the
\gls{MMU}).\\
\\

\requirement{OPC-0001} {Hardware constraints}{%
The execution of the tests defined in this document shall comply with all %
the operational constraints applicable to the hardware used in the tests.%
}{}

\chapter{Types of Tests}

In order to satisfy the verification and validation needs of the test campaign,
the following types of tests are defined for LeanOS:
\begin{itemize}
	\item unit and integration tests
	\item hardware-software tests
\end{itemize}


\section {Unit and Integration Tests}

LeanOS is developed as a collection of individual, interacting components.
A unit test verifies the behaviour of a single component, while an integration
test verifies the behaviour of a number of interacting components. \\

\noindent
Unit and integration tests are white-box type test that executes a component
with a series of input conditions and verify the output or action for the
expected response. These type of test are typically independent from the
hardware platform.\\
\\

\requirement{UIT-0001} {Unit/Integ. Tests}{%
Unit and Integration Tests shall be defined and executed for LeanOS components.
}{Tests can make use of the modified \emph{kselftest} framework provided %
in the LeanOS source tree.
}%

\requirement{UIT-0002} {Test Suite}{%
A unit and integration test suite shall be provided as a set of applications.
}{}%

\requirement{UIT-0003} {Automatic Test Execution}{%
A single mechanism shall be provided that automatically runs all unit and %
integration tests in sequence.%
}{The \emph{kselftest} framework in the LeanOS source tree provides a %
\emph{Makefile} setup that can be used for this purpose.}%

\requirement{UIT-0004} {Test Results}{%
The test suite shall generate feedback a human-readable report describing the %
outcome of each unit and integration test.%
}{}

\requirement{UIT-0005} {Automatic Testing}{%
A feedback mechanism shall be provided that allows an external automated %
testing mechanism to execute and detect the results of unit and integration %
tests.%
}{This is very useful for automated bisection of code versions, e.g. by %
using the \emph{git bisect run \ldots} functionality.}%


\section {Hardware-Software Tests}

These tests differ from unit and integration tests in that a particular hardware
platform is required for testing. All system-level integration tests fall in
this category.\\
\\

\requirement{HST-0001} {Hardware Tests}{%
Hardware-software tests shall be defined and executed for LeanOS components %
with the objective of verifying the behaviour of components which directly %
interact with the relevant target hardware.%
}{}

\requirement{HST-0002} {Test Suite}{%
A hardware-software test suite shall be provided as a set of applications.
}{}

\requirement{HST-0003} {Test Results}{%
The hardware-software tests shall generate feedback as a human-readable %
report describing the outcome of test.%
}{}


\requirement{HST-0004} {Automatic Testing}{%
A feedback mechanism shall be provided that allows an external automated %
testing mechanism to execute and detect the results of hardware-software tests.%
}{This is very useful for automated bisection of code versions, e.g. by %
using the \emph{git bisect run \ldots} functionality.}%


\section {Acceptance Tests}

Acceptance tests are performed by the user on the integrated processing unit.
Their objective is to exercise the selected LeanOS configuration while running
in its operational environment. The operational environment for LeanOS is
defined by the user according to their use case.\\



\requirement{ACT-0001} {Acceptance Tests}{%
Acceptance tests and their procedures shall be defined and executed for LeanOS.
}{}

\requirement{ACT-0002} {Use Cases}{%
The configuration and operational environment for an acceptance test of LeanOS
shall be defined by the user according to their use case.
}{}




\chapter{Test Environments}

Test beds in which LeanOS tests are performed:

\begin{itemize}
	\item general-purpose platform for regular unit and integration tests
	\item \gls{LEON2} and/or \gls{LEON3} platforms for hardware-software tests
	\item \gls{SSDP} and/or \gls{MPPB} for system-level hardware-software tests
\end{itemize}

\noindent
The test environments required for each category of test are described in the
following sections.

\newpage
\section{Unit and Integration Test Environment}

\begin{figure}[]
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\columnwidth]{images/unittest}
	\caption{Unit and integration test environment. Stubs and Mockups %
	are stand-ins for external dependencies with defined behaviour. %
	A set of input data is fed into the item under test as specified %
	in the test procedure.}
	\label{fig:unittest}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The test environment for unit and integration tests are shown in
\fig{fig:unittest}.\\

\noindent
The item under test is either one or a set of components of LeanOS. If needed,
stub and mockup functions, which simulate the expected behaviour of external
dependcies, are defined to create a representative environment in which the item
under test is running.\\

\noindent
Tests are controlled by a test sequence, which generates inputs for the item
under test and collects and evaluates the generated output.\\
\\

\requirement{UITE-0001} {Unit Test Environment}{%
Unit and integration tests shall be performed in an environment as defined in %
\fig{fig:unittest}. %
}{}%


\section{Hardware-Software Test Environment}

The hardware-software test environments are detailed on a per-test basis.\\
\\

\requirement{HSTE-0001} {HW/SW Test Environment}{%
The required hardware-software test environment shall be defined in the %
specification of each individual test.%
}{}%

\chapter{Test Coverage}

This chapter defines the coverage of tests in the environments defined in the
previously.


\section{Source Code Coverage}

Source code coverage must be achived in unit and integration tests.
A component is considered covered if full statement, decision and condition
coverage is achieved. \\

\noindent
If full coverage cannot be achieved, for example due to operational constraints,
deviations are acceptable provided that they are justified.\\
\\

\requirement{SCC-0001} {Statement Coverage}{%
Unit and integration tests shall offer full statement coverage for LeanOS code.%
}{}%

\requirement{SCC-0002} {Decision Coverage}{%
Unit and integration tests shall offer full decision coverage for LeanOS code.%
}{}%

\requirement{SCC-0003} {Condition Coverage}{%
Unit and integration tests shall offer full condition coverage for LeanOS code.%
}{}%

\requirement{SCC-0004} {Reduced Coverage}{%
If the coverage specififed in the previous requirements cannot be achieved %
due to operational contraints, justifications for deviations shall be provided %
for each of the individual conditions where the degree of coverage is below %
the specified goal. %
}{}%
